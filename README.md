# Crafty [working title]

This is the repository for a game developed for the [WebGameDev.io](https://webgamedev.com/) [Open Jam (April 2023)](https://www.webgamedev.com/open-jam-april-2023).

_Crafty_ is a game about helping supply the blacksmiths, armorers, alchemists, and other vendors that keep adventurers stocked and alive during their endeavours. You play Marvin, a lowly peasant in the small village of Metropolis. Metropolis just so happens to lie along a popular adventuring route, so the vendors in town need to stay well stocked to keep the town's economy strong.

Your job is to go into the nearby areas and retrieve the materials that the vendors of Metropolis require — wood, ore, herbs, as well as other rarer items — then return to town to to resupply the vendors. With time, practice, and a little bit of luck, you may even become a vendor yourself!

## Features

### Collecting supplies

Vendors will need all sorts of supplies to fullfill their orders. You must go into the wild to collect those supplies, return them to town, and sell them to vendors.

### RPG-style character advancements

Your character has a stat for each activity — woodcutting, mining, herbalism, etc. — which increases as you practice that skill. As you improve, you may be able to chop faster, or extract more ore from each node, or extract rarer herbs.

### Inventory management

Your backpack only has so much capacity, but you can try to shove as much stuff in it as you want! Be mindful, tho... overloaded bags tend to drop things.
